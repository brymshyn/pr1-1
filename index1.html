    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I, Rymshyn Bohdan Konstantinovich, a graduate of the 11th grade of the Volochysk educational complex No. 6, received information on the website of the Khmelnitsky National University about the bachelor's educational program in specialty 126 "Information Systems and Technologies" and became interested in it. I believe that this specialty at the present time - the time of computer technology - is the most relevant, and specialists in this field are in demand in the labor market.
        From the information that I received from the pages of the site of the Khmelnytsky National University, I made sure that the university provides high-quality modern education, also creates comfortable conditions for study. KhNU is the largest educational institution in Podillia, trains specialists of various specialties, actively works in the direction of international cooperation.
        Since childhood, I have been interested in computer technology and information technology. I believe your university can help me turn my dream into reality.
        During my studies at NVK No. 6, I liked such subjects as: Ukrainian language, computer science. At the end of school, I have good results in such school subjects: computer science - 11 points, Ukrainian language - 9 points, mathematics - 8 points. 27.07.22 year I passed the national multi-subject test: mathematics - 148 points, Ukrainian language - 163 points, history - 147 points.
        While studying at NOC No. 6, I helped the class teacher create presentations and videos on various topics. I always try to keep abreast of the level of development of IT technologies, I am interested in the news of computer technology, software and hardware.
        Summing up, I want to say that for me personally the choice of a profession is a responsible and complex step that does not tolerate frivolity, requires time to think, good knowledge and appropriate training. I want my chosen specialty and work in the future, was to my liking and brought me moral and material satisfaction, because most of my life a person devotes to work.
